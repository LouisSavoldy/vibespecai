### **Product Requirements Document: VibeSpecAI**
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft

**1. Introduction & Overview**
VibeSpecAI is a guided product development tool designed to bridge the gap between a high-level idea and a developer-ready plan. It addresses the "blank page" problem for creative founders, designers, and junior developers by providing a structured, conversational process to build a robust Product Requirements Document (PRD). This empowers "Aspiring Builders" to create architecturally sound applications and gives AI coding assistants the necessary context to generate high-quality, consistent code.

**2. Goals**
*   Solve the core problem of translating a product "vibe" into an actionable, well-structured PRD for the "Aspiring Builder."
*   Validate the core product hypothesis by successfully launching a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that users find valuable.
*   Achieve the following success metrics: High user engagement and successful generation of PRDs.

**3. User Persona**
The primary user for this product is the **"Aspiring Builder."** This persona represents a blend of non-technical founders, designers, and junior developers. They are creative and have strong product vision but may lack the deep technical or architectural experience to create a solid technical plan from scratch. They are united by the challenge of bridging the gap between a great idea and a well-executed project.

**4. User Stories (MVP)**
*   **Onboarding:** "As an Aspiring Builder, I want to sign in with my GitHub account so that I can securely access the application and prepare to save my project artifacts."
*   **Core Journey:** "As an Aspiring Builder, I want to create a new project and be guided through a series of questions about my idea, so that the system can automatically generate a structured Product Requirements Document for me."
*   **Refinement:** "As an Aspiring Builder, I want to review and edit the generated PRD in a simple editor, so that I can refine the details to perfectly match my vision."
*   **The Payoff:** "As an Aspiring Builder, I want to save my final PRD, which automatically creates a new repository in my GitHub account and places the document within an `ai-artifacts` folder, so that my project has a professional and organized starting point."

**5. MVP: Functional Requirements**
The following features have been identified as essential for the Minimum Viable Product. These features directly support the critical path user journey.

*   **Critical Path User Journey:**
    1.  User signs in with GitHub.
    2.  User creates a new project and gives it a name.
    3.  User is guided through a structured dialogue about their product idea.
    4.  The system generates a PRD based on their answers.
    5.  User reviews and edits the PRD in an on-screen editor.
    6.  User saves the final PRD, which creates a new GitHub repo and saves the `PRD.md` file within an `ai-artifacts/` folder.

*   **MVP Feature List:**
    *   **User Onboarding:** Integration with GitHub for user sign-in.
    *   **Project Creation:** Ability to start and name a new project.
    *   **AI-Guided Dialogue:** A conversational interface that asks structured questions to gather product requirements.
    *   **Markdown Editor:** An on-screen editor to review and modify the AI-generated PRD.
    *   **GitHub Repo Creation:** The system must be able to create a new public repository in the user's authenticated GitHub account.
    *   **File Scaffolding:** On save, the system will create an `ai-artifacts` folder and save the document as `PRD.md` inside it.

**6. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for MVP)**
To ensure focus and rapid delivery, the following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for the initial MVP. They will be considered for future versions based on user feedback.
*   User subscriptions and payments.
*   Connecting to or using an existing GitHub repository.
*   AI-guided selection of languages, frameworks, or technical specifications.
*   Generating instructions or detailed tasks for an AI coding agent.
*   Analyzing an existing codebase to add new features.
*   Saving drafts to local storage before syncing to GitHub.
*   A three-panel user interface (will be simplified for MVP).

**7. Design & Technical Considerations**
*   **UI Flow:** The MVP will use a two-phase interface: a sequential "Dialogue Phase" followed by a full-screen "Editor Phase."
*   **File Structure:** All generated artifacts for the MVP and future versions will be stored within an `ai-artifacts` folder in the user's repository.

**8. Success Metrics (Initial)**
*   **Activation Rate:** Percentage of users who sign in and successfully generate at least one PRD.
*   **Feature Adoption:** Number of PRDs successfully saved to GitHub.
*   **User Retention (Qualitative):** Gathering feedback on whether users would use the tool again for their next project.

**9. Open Questions**
*   (None at this time. All initial questions resolved.)
