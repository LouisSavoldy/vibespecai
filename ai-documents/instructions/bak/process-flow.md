Here is the correct, logical sequence:
Phase 1: Product Definition (The PRD)
The Idea: User provides their initial vibe.
Socratic Interview: VibeSpecAI asks questions about the User, Problem, and Features.
MVP Definition: The user and AI collaborate to define the MVP scope.
PRD Generation: VibeSpecAI generates the first draft of the PRD.md. This document now exists and defines what we are building.
Phase 2: Architectural & Tooling Definition
5. High-Level Tech Stack: VibeSpecAI asks, "What are the big building blocks?" (e.g., React frontend, Node.js backend).
6. Tooling & Library Deep Dive (This is where your question fits in): NOW that we know we're building a React/Node.js app with specific features defined in the PRD, VibeSpecAI can have an intelligent conversation about the tools.
* AI: "Okay, based on the PRD, your app has several complex forms. To handle these robustly, I recommend we use the 'React Hook Form' library. Does that sound good?"
* The AI can make smarter recommendations because it has the context of the PRD.
Phase 3: Implementation Blueprint Generation
7. AI_DIRECTIVES.md Generation: VibeSpecAI takes the choices from the "Tooling Deep Dive" and codifies them into the strict rules within the AI_DIRECTIVES.md file.
8. Feature Task Generation: VibeSpecAI can now generate hyper-specific tasks for the AI IDE.
* Bad Task (without tooling info): "Create a login form."
* Good Task (with tooling info): "Create a LoginForm component using React Hook Form for state management and Zod for validation. On submit, it should call the useLoginMutation hook from TanStack Query."
Summary


The sequence is critical:
Idea -> PRD (What) -> High-Level Stack -> Tooling Choices (How) -> Final Instructions (AI_DIRECTIVES + Tasks)
