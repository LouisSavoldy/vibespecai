# Feature: AI-Assisted Editing of Artifacts

**User Story:** As a VIBE Coder, I want to be able to modify any generated project artifact (e.g., PRD, feature files) using a conversational AI, so that I can easily refine and evolve my project blueprint.

**Related Wireframes:**
*   `/spec/wireframe.md` (Section 7: Editing an Existing Artifact)

---

## Implementation Tasks:

### Task 1: Implement Artifact Loading and Display

*   **File:** `src/features/artifact_editing/components/ArtifactEditor.tsx`
*   **UI:** Create a component that can load and display the content of various markdown files (PRD, TECH_STACK, AI_DIRECTIVES, feature files).
*   **Logic:**
    *   The component should take a file path as a prop.
    *   It should fetch the content of the file (initially from local storage/simulation, later from the backend/GitHub).
    *   Display the content in a readable format (e.g., using a markdown renderer).

### Task 2: Integrate AI Chat for Editing

*   **File:** `src/features/artifact_editing/components/AIEditChat.tsx`
*   **UI:** A chat interface similar to the Socratic interview, but focused on editing.
*   **Logic:**
    *   The chat should take the current artifact content as context.
    *   When the user provides instructions (e.g., "Add a new section about X"), the AI (simulated for now) should generate the modified content.
    *   The modified content should be displayed in the `ArtifactEditor` component.

### Task 3: Implement Local Saving of Edited Artifacts

*   **File:** `src/features/artifact_editing/utils/artifactSaver.ts`
*   **Logic:**
    *   Create a utility function to save the modified artifact content back to local storage/simulation.
    *   This will simulate the changes before they are pushed to GitHub (handled by State Synchronization feature).

### Task 4: Update Workspace to Support Editing

*   **File:** `src/pages/Workspace.tsx`
*   **Logic:**
    *   Modify the workspace to allow users to select a file from a file tree (simulated for now).
    *   When a file is selected, the `ArtifactEditor` component should be rendered in the center pane with the selected file's content.
    *   Ensure the AI chat on the right pane is contextually aware of the currently edited file.
